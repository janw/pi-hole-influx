A simple daemonized script to report Pi-Hole stats to an InfluxDB (v1) instance, ready to be displayed via Grafana. **Nowadays I store Pi-hole statistics in Prometheus using [eko/pihole-exporter](https://github.com/eko/pihole-exporter) instead. Thus am no longer actively using this project myself. I will try to merge Pull Reqests in a timely manner though.**

**‚ö†Ô∏è The docker image name has been changed to `ghcr.io/janw/pi-hole-influx`. Please update your deployment accordingly.**

## Setup (Using Docker)

* To use docker for running the daemon, use the following command:

  ```bash
  docker run \
    -e PIHOLE_INFLUXDB_HOST="myhostname" \
    -e PIHOLE_INFLUXDB_PORT="8086" \
    -e PIHOLE_INFLUXDB_USERNAME="myusername" \
    -e PIHOLE_INFLUXDB_PASSWORD="mysupersecretpassword" \
    -e PIHOLE_INFLUXDB_DATABASE="pihole" \
    -e PIHOLE_INSTANCES="localhost=http://127.0.0.1/admin/api.php?summaryRaw" \
    --network host \
    ghcr.io/janw/pi-hole-influx
  ```

The following values are the defaults and will be used if not set:

* `PIHOLE_INFLUXDB_PORT="8086"`
* `PIHOLE_INFLUXDB_HOST="127.0.0.1"`
* `PIHOLE_INFLUXDB_DATABASE="pihole"`
* `PIHOLE_INSTANCES="localhost=http://127.0.0.1/admin/api.php?summaryRaw"`

Note that the API URL is suffixed with `?summaryRaw` to allow pi-hole-influx to receive the correct data format.

### Authentication (new as of November 2022)

Newer versions of Pi-hole [require authentication when accessing the API](https://pi-hole.net/blog/2022/11/17/upcoming-changes-authentication-for-more-api-endpoints-required/#page-content) of an instance that has been configured with a web-interface password. If that is the case for your instance (as it should be), please make sure the API URL follows the format of

```text
http://<INSTANCE_HOST>/admin/api.php?summaryRaw&auth=<AUTH_TOKEN>
```

where `<AUTH_TOKEN>` should be replaced with the token you can find on the Pi-hole admin panel under Settings -> API / Web interface -> Show API token.

### Multiple instances

`PIHOLE_INSTANCES` contains the Pi-hole instances that are to be reported. Multiple instances can given in a dict-like boxed syntax, known as [Inline Tables in TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml#inline-table):

```bash
PIHOLE_INSTANCES="{first_one='http://127.0.0.1/admin/api.php?summaryRaw',second_pihole='http://192.168.42.79/admin/api.php?summaryRaw'[,‚Ä¶]}"
```

Note that instances can be prefixed by a custom name.

## Docker-compose example

If you want to run the daemon through Docker-compose, you might appreciate the configuration example below.

```yaml
version: "2"
services:
  piholeinflux:
    image: ghcr.io/janw/pi-hole-influx
    container_name: piholeinflux
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:

      # Replace details with your InfluxDB's hostname and credentials
      PIHOLE_INFLUXDB_HOST: "10.10.10.1"
      PIHOLE_INFLUXDB_PORT: "8086"
      PIHOLE_INFLUXDB_USERNAME: "pihole"
      PIHOLE_INFLUXDB_PASSWORD: "pihole"
      PIHOLE_INFLUXDB_DATABASE: "pihole"

      # Replace with your Pi-Hole's address including path to API below
      PIHOLE_INSTANCES: "pihole=http://10.10.0.10/admin/api.php"

    # OPTIONAL: Instead of the aobove environment variables,
    #           use a custom copy of the user.toml config file.
    volumes:
      - ./custom/config.toml:/user.toml
```

## Setup (Traditional Way)

As Pi-hole (as the name suggests) is built specifically with the Raspberry Pi in mind (and I run it on there as well), the following steps assume an instance of Pi-hole on Raspbian Strech Lite, with no additional modifications so far. Piholestatus will be configured to run on the same Pi.

First install the necessary packages via apt as Raspbian Lite does have neither git nor pip installed.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git python3-pip -y
```

Now clone the repo, install the Python dependencies, and make sure to copy and adjust the example configuation file to match your setup.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/janw/pi-hole-influx.git ~/pi-hole-influx
cd ~/pi-hole-influx

# Install requirements via pip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Copy config.example and modify it (should be self-explanatory)
cp user.toml.example user.toml
vi user.toml
```

Before starting the daemon for the first time, symlink the systemd service into place, reload, and enable the service. Note that if you are using a user that isn't `pi`, you must edit piholeinflux.service and change `ExecStart` to run the correct path. You must also change `User` to the correct user.

```bash
sudo ln -s piholeinflux.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl --system daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable piholeinflux.service
```

Now you're ready to start the daemon. Wait a few seconds to check its status.

```bash
sudo systemctl start piholeinflux.service
sudo systemctl status piholeinflux.service
```

The status should look as follows. Note the `Status:` line showing the last time, the daemon reported to InfluxDB:

```text
‚óè piholeinflux.service - Pi-hole-Influx - Send Pi-hole statistics to InfluxDB for visualization
   Loaded: loaded (/home/pi/pi-hole-influx/piholeinflux.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Fri 2018-06-22 19:03:56 UTC; 10min ago
     Docs: https://github.com/janw/pi-hole-influx
 Main PID: 21329 (python)
   Status: "Reported to InfluxDB at 2018-06-22 19:14:09 +0000"
   CGroup: /system.slice/piholeinflux.service
           ‚îî‚îÄ21329 /usr/bin/python /home/pi/pi-hole-influx/piholeinflux.py
```

## Set up a Grafana Dashboard

The example dashboard seen [at the top](#pi-hole-influx) uses the collected data and displays it in concise and sensible graphs and single stats. The dashboard can be imported into your Grafana instance from the `dashboard.json` file included in the repo, or by using ID `6603` to [import it from Grafana's Dashboard Directory](https://grafana.com/dashboards/6603).
